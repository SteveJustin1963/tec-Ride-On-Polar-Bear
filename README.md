### bear walking gait
What kind of gait Do bears have?
Within quadrupedal animals, a lateral walk, in which the placement of the hindfoot is followed by the placement of the ipsilateral forefoot, is the gait used at slow speeds by the majority of species, including bears (Hildebrand, 1976).

Do bears run or gallop?
Initial analysis of the video data shows that bears walk with an average speed of 1.7 m/s, use a running walk with an average speed of 2.6 m/s and canter with an average speed of 2.9 m/s.

How do bears walk?
Bears frequently move in an overstep walk, with the rear foot falling in front of where the front foot registered. The broadest part of the palm pad is on the outside and the shortest toe, which may not register, is on the inside. Bears toe-in and walk with most of their weight on the outside of their foot.
